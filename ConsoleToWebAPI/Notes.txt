Notes
=====
Each .NET core app is by default a console app.
We can add some services and make some changes to convert this console app into a Web API project


Host Builder
Host Builder is an object and its used to add some fetures in the application.
CreateDefaultBuilder ->
 By using the CreateDefaultBuilder we will get Dependency Injection by default
 Configuration =>
 1. appSettings.json
 2. appSettings.{env}.json
 3. User secrets
 4. Enviroment Variables etc.
 Logging
 Set the content root path to the result of GetCurrentDirectory() method
 
ConfigureWebHostDefaults ->
 Provides support for HTTP
 Sets the Kestrel server as the web server.
 Enables the IIS integration etc.
 
Startup.cs class
 we will add 2 methods ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services), Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
 Configure() => Here we add our middlewares
 
Controllers in web API
A controller class in Web API has a "controller" suffix e.g EmployeeController
The controller class must be inherited from ControllerBase
Use APIController attribute on the controller
Use Attrubute Routing 
The controller base class provides many method and properties to handle HTTP Request
Attrubute routing requirement
Handle the client Error i.e 400 status code
Multipart/form-data request inference
Bind the incoming data with parameters using some more attributes

Http Request 
Middleware
It sits between the Http Request Pipeline
Common Middleware
=================
1. Routing
2. Authentication
3. Add exception page

Methods in Middleware
1. Run() method is used to complete the middleware excution
2. Use() method is used to insert the new middleware in the pipeline i.e custom middleware
3. Next() method is used to pass the execution to the next middleware
4. Map() method is used to map the middleware to Specific URL

Routing
==========
Routingis the process of mapping incoming request(URL) to a particular resourse (the action method)
 => A single resourse can we accessed by any no. of unique routes creted for it
 => But multiple resourse cannot be accessed by single route
 => Routing is ebabled through Middleware
 => We need to insert the following 2 middleware in http pipeline
    1. UseRouting()
	2. UseEndpoint()
